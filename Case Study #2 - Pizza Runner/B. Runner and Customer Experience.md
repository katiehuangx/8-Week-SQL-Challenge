# 🍕 Case Study #2 Pizza Runner

## Solution - B. Runner and Customer Experience

### 1. How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)

````sql
SELECT 
  DATEPART(WEEK, registration_date) AS registration_week,
  COUNT(runner_id) AS runner_signup
FROM runners
GROUP BY DATEPART(WEEK, registration_date);
````

**Answer:**

- On Week 1 of Jan 2021, 2 new runners signed up.
- On Week 2 and 3 of Jan 2021, 1 new runner signed up.

### 2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?

````sql
WITH time_taken_cte AS
(
  SELECT 
    c.order_id, 
    c.order_time, 
    r.pickup_time, 
    DATEDIFF(MINUTE, c.order_time, r.pickup_time) AS pickup_minutes
  FROM #customer_orders AS c
  JOIN #runner_orders AS r
    ON c.order_id = r.order_id
  WHERE r.distance != 0
  GROUP BY c.order_id, c.order_time, r.pickup_time
)

SELECT 
  AVG(pickup_minutes) AS avg_pickup_minutes
FROM time_taken_cte
WHERE pickup_minutes > 1;
````

- The average time taken in minutes by runners to arrive at Pizza Runner HQ to pick up the order is 15 minutes.

### 3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?

````sql
WITH prep_time_cte AS
(
  SELECT 
    c.order_id, 
    COUNT(c.order_id) AS pizza_order, 
    c.order_time, 
    r.pickup_time, 
    DATEDIFF(MINUTE, c.order_time, r.pickup_time) AS prep_time_minutes
  FROM #customer_orders AS c
  JOIN #runner_orders AS r
    ON c.order_id = r.order_id
  WHERE r.distance != 0
  GROUP BY c.order_id, c.order_time, r.pickup_time
)

SELECT 
  pizza_order, 
  AVG(prep_time_minutes) AS avg_prep_time_minutes
FROM prep_time_cte
WHERE prep_time_minutes > 1
GROUP BY pizza_order;
````

**Answer:**

- On average, a single pizza order takes 12 minutes to prepare.
- An order with 3 pizzas takes 30 minutes at an average of 10 minutes per pizza.
- It takes 16 minutes to prepare an order with 2 pizzas which is 8 minutes per pizza — making 2 pizzas in a single order the ultimate efficiency rate.

### 4. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?

````sql
SELECT 
  c.customer_id, 
  AVG(r.distance) AS avg_distance
FROM #customer_orders AS c
JOIN #runner_orders AS r
  ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE r.duration != 0
GROUP BY c.customer_id;
````

_(Assuming that distance is calculated from Pizza Runner HQ to customer’s place)_

- Customer 104 stays the nearest to Pizza Runner HQ at average distance of 10km, whereas Customer 105 stays the furthest at 25km.

### 5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?

_Edit 08/10/21: Thanks to my reader, Ankush Taneja on Medium who caught my mistake. I've amended to the correct solution. Also, I was doing this case study using SQL Server few months ago, but I'm using PostgreSQL on SQLpad now so there could be a slight difference to the syntax._

Firstly, I'm going to filter results with non-null duration first just to have a feel. You can skip this step and go straight to the answer.

````sql
SELECT 
  order_id, duration
FROM #runner_orders
WHERE duration not like ' ';
````

```sql
SELECT MAX(duration::NUMERIC) - MIN(duration::NUMERIC) AS delivery_time_difference
FROM runner_orders2
where duration not like ' ';
```

- The difference between longest (40 minutes) and shortest (10 minutes) delivery time for all orders is 30 minutes.

### 6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?

````sql
SELECT 
  r.runner_id, 
  c.customer_id, 
  c.order_id, 
  COUNT(c.order_id) AS pizza_count, 
  r.distance, (r.duration / 60) AS duration_hr , 
  ROUND((r.distance/r.duration * 60), 2) AS avg_speed
FROM #runner_orders AS r
JOIN #customer_orders AS c
  ON r.order_id = c.order_id
WHERE distance != 0
GROUP BY r.runner_id, c.customer_id, c.order_id, r.distance, r.duration
ORDER BY c.order_id;
````

**Answer:**

_(Average speed = Distance in km / Duration in hour)_
- Runner 1’s average speed runs from 37.5km/h to 60km/h.
- Runner 2’s average speed runs from 35.1km/h to 93.6km/h. Danny should investigate Runner 2 as the average speed has a 300% fluctuation rate!
- Runner 3’s average speed is 40km/h

### 7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?

````sql
SELECT 
  runner_id, 
  ROUND(100 * SUM(
    CASE WHEN distance = 0 THEN 0
    ELSE 1 END) / COUNT(*), 0) AS success_perc
FROM #runner_orders
GROUP BY runner_id;
````

**Answer:**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/129740007-021d78fb-ec32-46c0-98f2-9e8f1891baed.png)

- Runner 1 has 100% successful delivery.
- Runner 2 has 75% successful delivery.
- Runner 3 has 50% successful delivery

_(It’s not right to attribute successful delivery to runners as order cancellations are out of the runner’s control.)_
