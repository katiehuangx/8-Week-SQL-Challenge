### 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?

````sql
SELECT s.customer_id, SUM(price) AS total_sales
FROM dbo.sales AS s
JOIN dbo.menu AS m
   ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id; 
````

#### Steps:
- Use **SUM** and **GROUP BY** to find out ```total_sales``` contributed by each customer.
- Use **JOIN** to merge ```sales``` and ```menu``` tables as ```customer_id``` and ```price``` are from both tables.


#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_sales |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

- Customer A spent $76.
- Customer B spent $74.
- Customer C spent $36.

***

### 2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?

````sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT(order_date)) AS visit_count
FROM dbo.sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
````

#### Steps:
- Use **DISTINCT** and wrap with **COUNT** to find out the ```visit_count``` for each customer.
- If we do not use **DISTINCT** on ```order_date```, the number of days may be repeated. For example, if Customer A visited the restaurant twice on '2021–01–07', then number of days is counted as 2 days instead of 1 day.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | visit_count |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 4          |
| B           | 6          |
| C           | 2          |

- Customer A visited 4 times.
- Customer B visited 6 times.
- Customer C visited 2 times.

### 3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?

````sql
WITH ordered_sales_cte AS
(
   SELECT customer_id, order_date, product_name,
      DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id
      ORDER BY s.order_date) AS rank
   FROM dbo.sales AS s
   JOIN dbo.menu AS m
      ON s.product_id = m.product_id
)

SELECT customer_id, product_name
FROM ordered_sales_cte
WHERE rank = 1
GROUP BY customer_id, product_name;
````

#### Steps:
- Create a temp table ```order_sales_cte``` and use **Windows function** with **DENSE_RANK** to create a new column ```rank``` based on ```order_date```.
- Instead of **ROW_NUMBER** or **RANK**, use **DENSE_RANK** as ```order_date``` is not time-stamped hence, there is no sequence as to which item is ordered first if 2 or more items are ordered on the same day.
- Subsequently, **GROUP BY** all columns to show ```rank = 1``` only.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | curry        | 
| A           | sushi        | 
| B           | curry        | 
| C           | ramen        |

- Customer A's first orders are curry and sushi.
- Customer B's first order is curry.
- Customer C's first order is ramen.

***

### 4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?

````sql
SELECT TOP 1 (COUNT(s.product_id)) AS most_purchased, product_name
FROM dbo.sales AS s
JOIN dbo.menu AS m
   ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.product_id, product_name
ORDER BY most_purchased DESC;
````

#### Steps:
- **COUNT** number of ```product_id``` and **ORDER BY** ```most_purchased``` by descending order. 
- Then, use **TOP 1** to filter highest number of purchased item.

#### Answer:
| most_purchased | product_name | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 8       | ramen |


- Most purchased item on the menu is ramen which is 8 times. Yummy!

For question no. 4, after finding the most purchased item on the menu (RAMEN), we can find how many time it was purchased by all customers by running the below code:

SELECT customer_id, COUNT(sales.product_id) AS product_count, menu.product_name
FROM prismatic-grail-337610.dannys_diner.sales
JOIN prismatic-grail-337610.dannys_diner.menu
ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
WHERE menu.product_name = 'ramen'
GROUP BY customer_id, menu.product_name

OUTPUT - 
Row	customer_id	product_count	product_name	
1	      A             3          ramen
2	      B             2          ramen
3	      C             3          ramen

So customer A had ordered RAMEN 3 times, customer B had ordered 2 times and customer C had ordered 3 times too.

### 5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?

````sql
WITH fav_item_cte AS
(
   SELECT s.customer_id, m.product_name, COUNT(m.product_id) AS order_count,
      DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id
      ORDER BY COUNT(s.customer_id) DESC) AS rank
   FROM dbo.menu AS m
   JOIN dbo.sales AS s
      ON m.product_id = s.product_id
   GROUP BY s.customer_id, m.product_name
)

SELECT customer_id, product_name, order_count
FROM fav_item_cte 
WHERE rank = 1;
````

#### Steps:
- Create a ```fav_item_cte``` and use **DENSE_RANK** to ```rank``` the ```order_count``` for each product by descending order for each customer.
- Generate results where product ```rank = 1``` only as the most popular product for each customer.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name | order_count |
| ----------- | ---------- |------------  |
| A           | ramen        |  3   |
| B           | sushi        |  2   |
| B           | curry        |  2   |
| B           | ramen        |  2   |
| C           | ramen        |  3   |

- Customer A and C's favourite item is ramen.
- Customer B enjoys all items on the menu. He/she is a true foodie, sounds like me!

### 6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?

````sql
WITH member_sales_cte AS 
(
   SELECT s.customer_id, m.join_date, s.order_date, s.product_id,
      DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id
      ORDER BY s.order_date) AS rank
   FROM sales AS s
   JOIN members AS m
      ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
   WHERE s.order_date >= m.join_date
)

SELECT s.customer_id, s.order_date, m2.product_name 
FROM member_sales_cte AS s
JOIN menu AS m2
   ON s.product_id = m2.product_id
WHERE rank = 1;
````

#### Steps:
- Create ```member_sales_cte``` by using **windows function** and partitioning ```customer_id``` by ascending ```order_date```. Then, filter ```order_date``` to be on or after ```join_date```.
- Then, filter table by ```rank = 1``` to show 1st item purchased by each customer.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | order_date  | product_name |
| ----------- | ---------- |----------  |
| A           | 2021-01-07 | curry        |
| B           | 2021-01-11 | sushi        |

- Customer A's first order as member is curry.
- Customer B's first order as member is sushi.

***

### 7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?

````sql
WITH prior_member_purchased_cte AS 
(
   SELECT s.customer_id, m.join_date, s.order_date, s.product_id,
         DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id
         ORDER BY s.order_date DESC) AS rank
   FROM sales AS s
   JOIN members AS m
      ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
   WHERE s.order_date < m.join_date
)

SELECT s.customer_id, s.order_date, m2.product_name 
FROM prior_member_purchased_cte AS s
JOIN menu AS m2
   ON s.product_id = m2.product_id
WHERE rank = 1;
````

#### Steps:
- Create a ```prior_member_purchased_cte``` to create new column ```rank``` by using **Windows function** and partitioning ```customer_id``` by descending ```order_date``` to find out the last ```order_date``` before customer becomes a member.
- Filter ```order_date``` before ```join_date```.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | order_date  | product_name |
| ----------- | ---------- |----------  |
| A           | 2021-01-01 |  sushi        |
| A           | 2021-01-01 |  curry        |
| B           | 2021-01-04 |  sushi        |

- Customer A’s last order before becoming a member is sushi and curry.
- Whereas for Customer B, it's sushi. That must have been a real good sushi!

***

### 8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?

````sql
SELECT s.customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT s.product_id) AS unique_menu_item, 
   SUM(mm.price) AS total_sales
FROM sales AS s
JOIN members AS m
   ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
JOIN menu AS mm
   ON s.product_id = mm.product_id
WHERE s.order_date < m.join_date
GROUP BY s.customer_id;

````

#### Steps:
- Filter ```order_date``` before ```join_date``` and perform a **COUNT** **DISTINCT** on ```product_id``` and **SUM** the ```total spent``` before becoming member.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | unique_menu_item | total_sales |
| ----------- | ---------- |----------  |
| A           | 2 |  25       |
| B           | 2 |  40       |

Before becoming members,
- Customer A spent $ 25 on 2 items.
- Customer B spent $40 on 2 items.

***

### 9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier — how many points would each customer have?

````sql
WITH price_points AS
(
   SELECT *, 
      CASE
         WHEN product_id = 1 THEN price * 20
         ELSE price * 10
      END AS points
   FROM menu
)

SELECT s.customer_id, SUM(p.points) AS total_points
FROM price_points_cte AS p
JOIN sales AS s
   ON p.product_id = s.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id
````

#### Steps:
Let’s breakdown the question.
- Each $1 spent = 10 points.
- But, sushi (product_id 1) gets 2x points, meaning each $1 spent = 20 points
So, we use CASE WHEN to create conditional statements
- If product_id = 1, then every $1 price multiply by 20 points
- All other product_id that is not 1, multiply $1 by 10 points
Using ```price_points```, **SUM** the ```points```.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_points | 
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | 860 |
| B           | 940 |
| C           | 360 |

- Total points for Customer A is 860.
- Total points for Customer B is 940.
- Total points for Customer C is 360.

### 10. 10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi — how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

````sql
WITH dates_cte AS 
(
   SELECT *, 
      DATEADD(DAY, 6, join_date) AS valid_date, 
      EOMONTH('2021-01-31') AS last_date
   FROM members AS m
)

SELECT d.customer_id, s.order_date, d.join_date, d.valid_date, d.last_date, m.product_name, m.price,
   SUM(CASE
      WHEN m.product_name = 'sushi' THEN 2 * 10 * m.price
      WHEN s.order_date BETWEEN d.join_date AND d.valid_date THEN 2 * 10 * m.price
      ELSE 10 * m.price
      END) AS points
FROM dates_cte AS d
JOIN sales AS s
   ON d.customer_id = s.customer_id
JOIN menu AS m
   ON s.product_id = m.product_id
WHERE s.order_date < d.last_date
GROUP BY d.customer_id, s.order_date, d.join_date, d.valid_date, d.last_date, m.product_name, m.price
````

#### Steps:
- In ```dates_cte```, find out customer’s ```valid_date``` (which is 6 days after ```join_date``` and inclusive of ```join_date```) and ```last_day``` of Jan 2021 (which is ‘2021–01–31’).

Our assumptions are:
- On Day -X to Day 1 (customer becomes member on Day 1 ```join_date```), each $1 spent is 10 points and for sushi, each $1 spent is 20 points.
- On Day 1 ```join_date``` to Day 7 ```valid_date```, each $1 spent for all items is 20 points.
- On Day 8 to ```last_day``` of Jan 2021, each $1 spent is 10 points and sushi is 2x points.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_points | 
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | 1370 |
| B           | 820 |

- Total points for Customer A is 1,370.
- Total points for Customer B is 820.

### Rank All The Things - Danny also requires further information about the ```ranking``` of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ```ranking``` values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.

````sql
WITH summary_cte AS 
(
   SELECT s.customer_id, s.order_date, m.product_name, m.price,
      CASE
      WHEN mm.join_date > s.order_date THEN 'N'
