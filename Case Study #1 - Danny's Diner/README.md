## Question and Solution

Please join me in executing the queries using PostgreSQL on [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/2rM8RAnq7h5LLDTzZiRWcd/138). It would be great to work together on the questions!

Additionally, I have also published this case study on [Medium](https://katiehuangx.medium.com/8-week-sql-challenge-case-study-week-1-dannys-diner-2ba026c897ab?source=friends_link&sk=ed355696f5a70ff8b3d5a1b905e5dabe).

If you have any questions, reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katiehuangx/).

**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

````sql
SELECT 
  sales.customer_id, 
  SUM(menu.price) AS total_sales
FROM dannys_diner.sales
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY sales.customer_id ASC; 
````

#### Steps:
- Use **JOIN** to merge `dannys_diner.sales` and `dannys_diner.menu` tables as `sales.customer_id` and `menu.price` are from both tables.
- Use **SUM** to calculate the total sales contributed by each customer.
- Group the aggregated results by `sales.customer_id`. 

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_sales |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

- Customer A spent $76.
- Customer B spent $74.
- Customer C spent $36.

***

**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**

````sql
SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS visit_count
FROM dannys_diner.sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
````

#### Steps:
- To determine the unique number of visits for each customer, utilize **COUNT(DISTINCT `order_date`)**.
- It's important to apply the **DISTINCT** keyword while calculating the visit count to avoid duplicate counting of days. For instance, if Customer A visited the restaurant twice on '2021‚Äì01‚Äì07', counting without **DISTINCT** would result in 2 days instead of the accurate count of 1 day.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | visit_count |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 4          |
| B           | 6          |
| C           | 2          |

- Customer A visited 4 times.
- Customer B visited 6 times.
- Customer C visited 2 times.

***

**3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**

````sql
WITH ordered_sales AS (
  SELECT 
    sales.customer_id, 
    sales.order_date, 
    menu.product_name,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (
      PARTITION BY sales.customer_id 
      ORDER BY sales.order_date) AS rank
  FROM dannys_diner.sales
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
    ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
)

SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  product_name
FROM ordered_sales
WHERE rank = 1
GROUP BY customer_id, product_name;
````

#### Steps:
- Create a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `ordered_sales_cte`. Within the CTE, create a new column `rank` and calculate the row number using **DENSE_RANK()** window function. The **PARTITION BY** clause divides the data by `customer_id`, and the **ORDER BY** clause orders the rows within each partition by `order_date`.
- In the outer query, select the appropriate columns and apply a filter in the **WHERE** clause to retrieve only the rows where the rank column equals 1, which represents the first row within each `customer_id` partition.
- Use the GROUP BY clause to group the result by `customer_id` and `product_name`.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name | 
| ----------- | -----------  |
| A           | curry        | 
| A           | sushi        | 
| B           | curry        | 
| C           | ramen        |

- Customer A placed an order for both curry and sushi simultaneously, making them the first items in the order.
- Customer B's first order is curry.
- Customer C's first order is ramen.

I have received feedback suggesting the use of `ROW_NUMBER()` instead of `DENSE_RANK()` for determining the "first order" in this question. 

However, since the `order_date` does not have a timestamp, it is impossible to determine the exact sequence of items ordered by the customer. 

Therefore, it would be inaccurate to conclude that curry is the customer's first order purely based on the alphabetical order of the product names. For this reason, I maintain my solution of using `DENSE_RANK()` and consider both curry and sushi as Customer A's first order.

***

**4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?**

````sql
SELECT 
  menu.product_name,
  COUNT(sales.product_id) AS most_purchased_item
FROM dannys_diner.sales
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY menu.product_name
ORDER BY most_purchased_item DESC
LIMIT 1;
````

#### Steps:
- Perform a **COUNT** aggregation on the `product_id` column and **ORDER BY** the result in descending order using `most_purchased` field.
- Apply the **LIMIT** 1 clause to filter and retrieve the highest number of purchased items.

#### Answer:
| most_purchased | product_name | 
| -----------    | -----------  |
| 8              |    ramen     |


- Most purchased item on the menu is ramen which is 8 times. Yummy!

***

**5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?**

````sql
WITH most_popular AS (
  SELECT 
    sales.customer_id, 
    menu.product_name, 
    COUNT(menu.product_id) AS order_count,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (
      PARTITION BY sales.customer_id 
      ORDER BY COUNT(sales.customer_id) DESC) AS rank
  FROM dannys_diner.menu
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.sales
    ON menu.product_id = sales.product_id
  GROUP BY sales.customer_id, menu.product_name
)

SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  product_name, 
  order_count
FROM most_popular 
WHERE rank = 1;
````

*Each user may have more than 1 favourite item.*

#### Steps:
- Create a CTE named `fav_item_cte` and within the CTE, join the `menu` table and `sales` table using the `product_id` column.
- Group results by `sales.customer_id` and `menu.product_name` and calculate the count of `menu.product_id` occurrences for each group. 
- Utilize the **DENSE_RANK()** window function to calculate the ranking of each `sales.customer_id` partition based on the count of orders **COUNT(`sales.customer_id`)** in descending order.
- In the outer query, select the appropriate columns and apply a filter in the **WHERE** clause to retrieve only the rows where the rank column equals 1, representing the rows with the highest order count for each customer.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name | order_count |
| ----------- | ---------- |------------  |
| A           | ramen        |  3   |
| B           | sushi        |  2   |
| B           | curry        |  2   |
| B           | ramen        |  2   |
| C           | ramen        |  3   |

- Customer A and C's favourite item is ramen.
- Customer B enjoys all items on the menu. He/she is a true foodie, sounds like me.

***

**6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?**

```sql
WITH joined_as_member AS (
  SELECT
    members.customer_id, 
    sales.product_id,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY members.customer_id
      ORDER BY sales.order_date) AS row_num
  FROM dannys_diner.members
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.sales
    ON members.customer_id = sales.customer_id
    AND sales.order_date > members.join_date
)

SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  product_name 
FROM joined_as_member
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON joined_as_member.product_id = menu.product_id
WHERE row_num = 1
ORDER BY customer_id ASC;
```

#### Steps:
- Create a CTE named `joined_as_member` and within the CTE, select the appropriate columns and calculate the row number using the **ROW_NUMBER()** window function. The **PARTITION BY** clause divides the data by `members.customer_id` and the **ORDER BY** clause orders the rows within each `members.customer_id` partition by `sales.order_date`.
- Join tables `dannys_diner.members` and `dannys_diner.sales` on `customer_id` column. Additionally, apply a condition to only include sales that occurred *after* the member's `join_date` (`sales.order_date > members.join_date`).
- In the outer query, join the `joined_as_member` CTE with the `dannys_diner.menu` on the `product_id` column.
- In the **WHERE** clause, filter to retrieve only the rows where the row_num column equals 1, representing the first row within each `customer_id` partition.
- Order result by `customer_id` in ascending order.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | ramen        |
| B           | sushi        |

- Customer A's first order as a member is ramen.
- Customer B's first order as a member is sushi.

***

**7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?**

````sql
WITH purchased_prior_member AS (
  SELECT 
    members.customer_id, 
    sales.product_id,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY members.customer_id
      ORDER BY sales.order_date DESC) AS rank
  FROM dannys_diner.members
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.sales
    ON members.customer_id = sales.customer_id
    AND sales.order_date < members.join_date
)

SELECT 
  p_member.customer_id, 
  menu.product_name 
FROM purchased_prior_member AS p_member
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON p_member.product_id = menu.product_id
WHERE rank = 1
ORDER BY p_member.customer_id ASC;
````

#### Steps:
- Create a CTE called `purchased_prior_member`. 
- In the CTE, select the appropriate columns and calculate the rank using the **ROW_NUMBER()** window function. The rank is determined based on the order dates of the sales in descending order within each customer's group.
- Join `dannys_diner.members` table with `dannys_diner.sales` table based on the `customer_id` column, only including sales that occurred *before* the customer joined as a member (`sales.order_date < members.join_date`).
- Join `purchased_prior_member` CTE with `dannys_diner.menu` table based on `product_id` column.
- Filter the result set to include only the rows where the rank is 1, representing the earliest purchase made by each customer before they became a member.
- Sort the result by `customer_id` in ascending order.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | sushi        |
| B           | sushi        |

- Both customers' last order before becoming members are sushi.

***

**8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?**

```sql
SELECT 
  sales.customer_id, 
  COUNT(sales.product_id) AS total_items, 
  SUM(menu.price) AS total_sales
FROM dannys_diner.sales
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.members
  ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
  AND sales.order_date < members.join_date
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY sales.customer_id;
```

#### Steps:
- Select the columns `sales.customer_id` and calculate the count of `sales.product_id` as total_items for each customer and the sum of `menu.price` as total_sales.
- From `dannys_diner.sales` table, join `dannys_diner.members` table on `customer_id` column, ensuring that `sales.order_date` is earlier than `members.join_date` (`sales.order_date < members.join_date`).
- Then, join `dannys_diner.menu` table to `dannys_diner.sales` table on `product_id` column.
- Group the results by `sales.customer_id`.
- Order the result by `sales.customer_id` in ascending order.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_items | total_sales |
| ----------- | ---------- |----------  |
| A           | 2 |  25       |
| B           | 3 |  40       |

Before becoming members,
- Customer A spent $25 on 2 items.
- Customer B spent $40 on 3 items.

**9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier ‚Äî how many points would each customer have?**

```sql
WITH points_cte AS (
  SELECT 
    menu.product_id, 
    CASE
      WHEN product_id = 1 THEN price * 20
      ELSE price * 10 END AS points
  FROM dannys_diner.menu
)

SELECT 
  sales.customer_id, 
  SUM(points_cte.points) AS total_points
FROM dannys_diner.sales
INNER JOIN points_cte
  ON sales.product_id = points_cte.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY sales.customer_id;
```

#### Steps:
Let's break down the question to understand the point calculation for each customer's purchases.
- Each $1 spent = 10 points. However, `product_id` 1 sushi gets 2x points, so each $1 spent = 20 points.
- Here's how the calculation is performed using a conditional CASE statement:
	- If product_id = 1, multiply every $1 by 20 points.
	- Otherwise, multiply $1 by 10 points.
- Then, calculate the total points for each customer.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_points | 
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | 860 |
| B           | 940 |
| C           | 360 |

- Total points for Customer A is $860.
- Total points for Customer B is $940.
- Total points for Customer C is $360.

**10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi ‚Äî how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?**

```sql
WITH dates_cte AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id, 
      join_date, 
      join_date + 6 AS valid_date, 
      DATE_TRUNC(
        'month', '2021-01-31'::DATE)
        + interval '1 month' 
        - interval '1 day' AS last_date
  FROM dannys_diner.members
)

SELECT 
  sales.customer_id, 
  SUM(CASE
    WHEN menu.product_name = 'sushi' THEN 2 * 10 * menu.price
    WHEN sales.order_date BETWEEN dates.join_date AND dates.valid_date THEN 2 * 10 * menu.price
    ELSE 10 * menu.price END) AS points
FROM dannys_diner.sales
INNER JOIN dates_cte AS dates
  ON sales.customer_id = dates.customer_id
  AND dates.join_date <= sales.order_date
  AND sales.order_date <= dates.last_date
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id;
```

#### Assumptions:
- On Day -X to Day 1 (the day a customer becomes a member), each $1 spent earns 10 points. However, for sushi, each $1 spent earns 20 points.
- From Day 1 to Day 7 (the first week of membership), each $1 spent for any items earns 20 points.
- From Day 8 to the last day of January 2021, each $1 spent earns 10 points. However, sushi continues to earn double the points at 20 points per $1 spent.

#### Steps:
- Create a CTE called `dates_cte`. 
- In `dates_cte`, calculate the `valid_date` by adding 6 days to the `join_date` and determine the `last_date` of the month by subtracting 1 day from the last day of January 2021.
- From `dannys_diner.sales` table, join `dates_cte` on `customer_id` column, ensuring that the `order_date` of the sale is after the `join_date` (`dates.join_date <= sales.order_date`) and not later than the `last_date` (`sales.order_date <= dates.last_date`).
- Then, join `dannys_diner.menu` table based on the `product_id` column.
- In the outer query, calculate the points by using a `CASE` statement to determine the points based on our assumptions above. 
    - If the `product_name` is 'sushi', multiply the price by 2 and then by 10. For orders placed between `join_date` and `valid_date`, also multiply the price by 2 and then by 10. 
    - For all other products, multiply the price by 10.
- Calculate the sum of points for each customer.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_points | 
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | 1020 |
| B           | 320 |

- Total points for Customer A is 1,020.
- Total points for Customer B is 320.
